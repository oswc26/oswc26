            <h2>Call</h2>
            <p>
                Our knowledge of organizations is constituted through work and through our understandings of work.
                Twenty-five years since the call to “bring work back in,” workers and their activities are increasingly
                central to theories of organizing.
            </p> 
                    
            <p>
                The 2026 Organization Science Winter Conference brings together
                scholars who examine how the organization and accomplishment of work relate to interactional
                processes, workplace experiences, institutional dynamics, and technological change. We also invite
                reflections on the work of doing organizational research in a time of rapid and significant technological
                and institutional change.
            </p> 
                    
            <p>
                The conference encourages submission of original research that investigates
                how work and workers inform organization science theory and practice, while also inviting reflections
                about how the changing conditions of academic labor are transforming the work of organization
                science and its implications for the future of our field. We welcome research employing a range of
                methodological approaches across global contexts, and from both contemporary and historical
                perspectives.
            </p>

            <p>Illustrative but not exhaustive topics of research to be included in the conference are:</p>
                
            <h3>Organizing Jobs, Roles and Tasks</h3> 
            <p>
                Jobs, roles, and tasks are the building blocks of organizational
                life but how they are structured, differentiated, and connected varies widely across settings and over
                time. We invite research that examines how organizations allocate tasks, define roles, and construct
                or contest occupational boundaries. How is work parceled out, combined, or coordinated? How do
                organizational, technological, and institutional forces shape job structures and task assignments and
                with what consequences? We especially welcome studies that illuminate the everyday practices,
                tensions, and negotiations through which jobs and roles are enacted, maintained, or transformed.
                We encourage papers addressing these questions at any level of analysis (individual, team, and/or
                organizational).
            </p>

            <h3>The Dynamics of Collaboration and Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Through daily interactions and acts of collaboration workers accomplish organizational goals. 
                Understanding these accomplishments depends on studies the behaviors and processes of collaboration, communication, 
                conflict resolution, coordination, routines, and role systems as the means through which knowledge, expertise, and skill 
                are integrated and orchestrated in workplaces. We invite research that examines how work is enacted by individuals 
                and teams within organizations as well as across organizations. Going beyond well-studied settings, we especially 
                encourage attention to remote and hybrid work, work in the public sector, and work in the global south. 
            </p>

            <h3>The Evolving Experience of Work</h3>
            <p>
                How work impacts the experience of workers offers interesting questions as the nature of work is changing. 
                How technologies, structures, processes, policies, and routines impact the day-to-day experience of workers, 
                including among different worker groups, pose important questions for the study of organizations. 
                We invite research that looks at how the worker experience is shaped by the organization context, 
                especially in ways which impact the ultimate success and viability of organizations themselves.
            </p>

            <h3> Markets, Institutions, and Intermediaries</h3>
            <p>
                Work is embedded in and influenced by the institutional and market contexts in which it unfolds. 
                Markets, whether labor, capital or product, define the demand for skills, drive firm strategy, 
                as well as impact wages and working conditions. Institutions, including legal frameworks, welfare systems, 
                along with educational and training structures, provide norms and rules that govern employment relationships, 
                worker protections and access to opportunities. Intermediaries such as financial institutions, platforms, 
                labor market agencies, certification bodies, trade unions and professional associations mediate access to opportunities, 
                resources, and recognition. We invite research that examines how these forces affect how work is 
                organized, valued, and transformed across different institutional environments and market systems. 
                This includes studies of how platforms and intermediaries impact the structure, meaning, and experience of work. 
                How do they affect access to work, the distribution of rewards, or the construction of legitimacy and expertise? 
                How do financial or legal changes alter job design? How do institutional logics and market pressures jointly 
                influence organizational responses to new forms of labor, employment, and organizing? We welcome work that illuminates 
                the macro-micro linkages through which work is constructed and contested.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Emerging Technologies</h3>

            <p>As new technologies spanning artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, 
                and immersive platforms (AR/VR) take root in the workplace, organizations face complex decisions about adaptation, 
                timing, and strategic response. How do emerging technologies reshape work, organizing, innovation, and expertise? 
                We invite research that explores how technologies transform work practices and innovation processes, 
                as well as work that examines the temporal dynamics and the complex processes through which organizations adapt to, 
                resist, or actively shape emerging technological landscapes. This includes how emerging technologies are restructuring 
                task allocation and coordination in digitally-mediated work environments and reshaping innovation ecosystems, R&D, and 
                team partnerships. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Work as Strategy</h3>

            <p>
                People have always been core to the design and execution of firm
                strategy, from boundary of the firm questions such as M& A to the role of culture, operations,
                executive decision-making, human capital, delegation and control, incentive design, and
                innovation. As the strategy field has grown to embrace the study of people, there are new
                opportunities to understand the complementarities between policies around people and the
                other activities and design decisions of the firm.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Work of Organization Science in a Changing World</h3>

            <p>
                Researchers in the field of organization science have access to a growing range of technologies, 
                empirical settings, and data sources that may change both how we do research and what we study. 
                At the same time universities are under threat,  the authority of expertise in societal matters is contested, 
                and managers and firms' demands for new knowledge about organization science are evolving. 
                Research that considers how changing technological and social contexts are transforming the resources 
                and roles of organization scientists across the world is welcome.
